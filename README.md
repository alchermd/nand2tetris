# nand2tetris

This repository contains my solutions for the projects in the book _[The Elements of Computing Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539807/the-elements-of-computing-systems/)_, which is more commonly known as the [NAND2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course.

## Motivation

I've heard of NAND2Tetris back in 2016 and have attempted to finish it for at least half a dozen times by now. As a challenge to myself, I'd like to finish the book/course by the end of Q1 2025. To maximize my learning, I'll document what learned with each project/chapter.

## Repository Structure

For each chapter, a README file containing my notes are found in the [chapters](./chapters) directory. In the same directory, a `project` folder contains the source code for that chapter's project. Instructions on how to run each chapter's project can be found in their respective README file.

The nand2tetris software suite is included in the [tools](./tools) directory.
