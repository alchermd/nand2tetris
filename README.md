# nand2tetris

This repository contains my solutions for the projects in the book _[The Elements of Computing Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539807/the-elements-of-computing-systems/)_, which is more commonly known as the [NAND2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course.

## Motivation

I've heard of NAND2Tetris back in 2016 and have attempted to finish it for at least half a dozen times by now. As a challenge to myself, I'd like to finish the book/course by the end of Q1 2025. To maximize my learning, I'll document what learned with each project/chapter.
